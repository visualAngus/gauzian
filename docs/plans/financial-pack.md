|------|--------------|------------|-----|-------|
| **Y1** | 1,000 | 30-50 | €3-8k | Beta + early traction |

| Conversion +2% (5%→7%) | +€40k ARR |
| Conversion -2% (5%→3%) | -€40k ARR |
| CAC +50% (€35→€52) | -15% LTV:CAC |
| Churn +3% (5%→8%) | -25% LTV |

---

## 7. Recommended Financial Actions

1. **Secure €300k pre-seed** — Enables 12-18 months runway, 1-2 additional devs, and beta acquisition
2. **Target 5% conversion minimum** — Critical for LTV:CAC >5x; requires strong onboarding
3. **Launch SMB tier by Y2** — Higher ARPU (€25-50) significantly improves unit economics
4. **Monitor CAC closely** — SEO/content marketing must stay below €40 to maintain healthy unit economics
5. **Plan for Series A at €150k ARR** — Typical EU B2B SaaS threshold; prepare metrics dashboard
6. **Explore BPI France loans** — JEI (Jeune Entreprise Innovante) + amortissement for non-dilutive capital

## 8. Risk Factors & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Low conversion (<3%) | Medium | High | A/B test pricing, improve onboarding, add features |
| Extended dev timeline | Medium | High | MVP scope discipline, prioritize core E2EE |
| Compliance costs > budget | Low | Medium | Start with basic RGPD; SecNumCloud deferred to Y2 |
| Competitor price war | Low | Medium | Differentiate on E2EE + France; not a race to bottom |
